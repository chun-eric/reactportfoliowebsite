### Reflection

<h4>Context:</h4>
I built this portfolio as a personal project to showcase my skills and work as a Digital Content and Marketing Lead, Growth Marketer. Itâ€™s a platform I use to demonstrate my expertise to potential clients and hiring managers.

<h4>Objective:</h4>
My goal was to create a visually appealing, responsive, and user-friendly site that highlights my work and skills while reflecting my personal style. I wanted to emphasize the blend of Western and Eastern design elements that are part of my identity.

<h4>Challenges:</h4>
There were many challenges with this project that I couldn't have forseen but managed to overcome with a lot of trial and error, thinking, Googling and AI help.
<br>
<br>
How do you insert a custom responsive slider that brings in dynamic information?
<br>
How do you add analytics to a website?
<br>
How do you optimize the website for better performance?
<br>
How do you create customized animations with only css?
<br>
How do I create a dark mode feature and save it in local storage?
<br>
How do I build a custom form so any can contact me, then validate the data then send the information to a safe third party API email message provider?
<br>
<br>
I also spent a significant amount of time making sure the website was responsive and performs well across devices and browsers.
